Info:

    biscuit simplifies the managing and the organization of cookies, it reads
    lines from standard input in the form:

        host name=value; name=value; ...

    parses them and applies some logic according to its known services, for
    example it discards equivalent entries by using a specific field as a key or
    it skips some useless fields in the output. The result is dumped on standard
    output. Several formats are available: quoted Javascript to be pasted in the
    URL bar of the browser, Wget command invocation, etc.

    Both service and printer interfaces are modular.

Dependencies:

    python (>= 2.7.3)

Examples:

    List all the available services:

        $ biscuit list services

    List all the available printers:

        $ biscuit list printers

    Describe the "js-url" printer:

        $ biscuit describe js-url

    Parse a text file processing all known services and also reporting unknown
    cookies using the default printer:

        $ biscuit parse < cookies.txt

    Use tshark to extract cookies from a pcap file and process only the facebook
    ones using Javascript output, unknown cookies are discarded:

        $ tshark -r file.cap \
                 -R 'http.cookie and http.host' \
                 -T fields -e http.host -e http.cookie \
          | biscuit parse -n js-url facebook

Custom modules:

    A module is a Python file located in services/ for the former and in
    printers/ for the latter. Working examples can be found in that folders.

    Both default service (core/default_service.py) and printer
    (core/default_printer.py) can be used as a template for creating new
    modules.
